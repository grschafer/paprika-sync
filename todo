========

- fix not being able to debug w/ ipdb
  - runserver wasn't pid 1 in the container, so added 'exec' to start script
- TODO: install sass and watch
  - could take package.json and gulpfile.js from cookiecutter-django to mimic if I had answered YES to using a js_task_runner...
  - but just going to brew install sass and run it in --watch mode outside docker, for now
  - `sass --watch sass/project.scss css/project.css`
  - TODO: figure out sass with compressor for production deployment
- making /add-paprika-account view and form
  - form shows up, but formatting is bad
  - handle form submission and call actions.import_account
  - test error cases (bad credentials, can't reach paprika API, etc.)
  - redirect first-login to add-paprika-account
  - test large number of recipes (does import need to be async somehow?)
    - too slow
      - ideas: multiprocessing pool, celery, every-minute cronjob
      - do every-minute cronjob... simplest while still performant
  - create newsitem on new account import
  - add basic newsfeed to homepage
  - TODO: fix logging config (no log statements or prints show in docker)


general
