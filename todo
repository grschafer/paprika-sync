========

- making /add-paprika-account view and form
  - form shows up, but formatting is bad
  - handle form submission and call actions.import_account
  - TODO: test error cases (bad credentials, can't reach paprika API, etc.)
  - TODO: test large number of recipes (does import need to be async somehow?)
- fix not being able to debug w/ ipdb
  - runserver wasn't pid 1 in the container, so added 'exec' to start script


general
=======

to start local server: docker-compose -f local.yml up

to run tests: docker-compose -f local.yml run django pytest paprika_sync/core

see bashin.sh for docker commands (e.g. running a shell)

see tasks here: https://github.com/grschafer/paprika-sync/projects/1

to force rebuild the container...
    force rebuild: docker-compose build django
    or delete the image: docker rmi -f paprika_sync_local_django
